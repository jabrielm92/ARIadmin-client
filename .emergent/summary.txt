The AI engineer successfully progressed the ARI Solutions Inc. Admin Dashboard and Client Management Platform. Initial phases established the Admin Dashboard and Client Portal with mocked authentication, then implemented a dark theme and initial client-side lead actions and a revamped homepage. A significant pivot involved migrating from Firebase to MongoDB for data storage and integrating Vapi.ai for the AI Virtual Receptionist. Key challenges included debugging client login after the MongoDB transition and resolving 404 errors for newly created client detail pages and admin service configuration pages. The work has systematically moved through Phase 1 (Core Admin Onboarding) and partially into Phase 2 (AI Virtual Receptionist), focusing on both client-facing setup and administrative oversight. The latest efforts concentrate on enhancing admin-side management for client services.

<product_requirements>
The project aims to create a Next.js 14 Admin Dashboard and Client Management Platform for ARI Solutions Inc. to manage AI Virtual Receptionist and Appointment Booking Accelerator (ABA) services. It involves client management, service configuration, and client-side analytics/settings. Technologies include Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Firebase/Firestore (initially intended, now MongoDB), Firebase Auth (mocked), Resend, Vercel Blob, and integrations with Vapi.ai. Initial integrations (Vapi.ai, Bland AI, Twilio, Calendly, ElevenLabs) use mock data. The application is built in phases: Admin Dashboard Foundation, AI Virtual Receptionist Configuration, ABA Configuration, Client Portal, and Analytics Dashboard. New requests include ARI Lead Gen service, replacing Stripe with PayPal, and enhancing admin-side management for client services.
